Eixo is a digital design studio that brings clarity to complex products and services. We align people, processes, and purpose through intentional design so teams can move with focus and confidence.

## About the studio
- Amsterdam-based, working worldwide across digital products, services, and design systems.
- We design from the inside out, integrating service design, UX craft, and systems thinking.
- The goal is functional, resilient experiences; aesthetics emerge from clarity, not trends.
- Led by Natalia Arsand, a UX Design Lead with 15+ years across Dell, ThoughtWorks, startups, and Booking.com’s design systems.

## What we do
- **Consultancy:** Discovery and alignment workshops, systems and workflow mapping, service and experience strategy, decision frameworks, and organisational clarity.
- **Delivery:** UX/UI for web and mobile, design systems setup and documentation, internal tools and workflow interfaces, automation support, and developer collaboration.

## How we work
- Ask the hard questions early to surface risks while there’s time to act.
- Frame problems carefully so we solve the real ones, not just the loud ones.
- Design for continuity by connecting flows, people, and tools into resilient systems.
- Collaborate over authority; progress comes from shared understanding, not titles.
