Dear Linor and Eric,
Here’s what I understood from our first conversation, and my proposal for how we could kick things off.
Running SingWell means juggling many moving parts: teaching, rehearsals, student management, events, communication, and plenty of admin work. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed, short on time, and distracted from the parts you truly enjoy (especially Linor!): teaching and making music.
That’s why, as a UX designer, I immediately thought a business clarity workshop would be the best first step. Instead of hiring me (or anyone else) straight into an Operations Manager role, this session will give us a clear picture of what’s really needed.
Think of it as a rehearsal, but instead of music, we put your business on stage. Over 3-4 hours, I’ll guide you through a structured yet creative process where we:
1. Map the whole picture
Lay out all the elements of your work,  from classes and workshops to admin and communications, so you can see clearly and visually how everything connects.
2. Find the bottlenecks and opportunities
Spot where time and energy are being lost, where things could be simplified, and what’s most important right now.
3. Prioritise and decide next steps
 Create a focused plan:
* What’s most urgent to act on (or let go of)
* Where I could support you further
* What could be automated with tools or better processes
* What could be handled more cheaply by part-timers or freelancers
The goal is to bring clarity and focus to how the business is working and where we want to go. You might say, “But we already know this”, and, of course, you know your business best. The difference is: I don’t.
Think of this session as a crash course into SingWell for me. Instead of spending weeks slowly learning how things work, this workshop lets me absorb the full picture in just a few hours. That way, if you decide to keep working together afterwards, I’ll already be ready to jump straight into action, focused on the right things.


format
* 3-4 hours, ideally in person (online possible if needed)

* Collaborative, guided and hands-on. Not just talk, but producing visual artefacts you can keep

* Afterwards, I will put together a structured document with findings and recommendations, ready to guide your next steps

Why I believe in this
Jumping straight into hiring operations help can easily lead to mismatched expectations. This workshop aligns all parties, ensuring support is targeted where you truly need it, saving time and money. It also means you get the maximum benefit from my expertise, not only execution, but also designing how your work can flow more efficiently.
Investment
I’ve facilitated mapping and prioritisation sessions many times before, both in companies I’ve worked with and in classes I’ve taught. It’s something I particularly enjoy, and it’s closely aligned with the company I’m building, eixo.design.
Since your needs fit this approach so well, I’d love to offer it as a pilot at a reduced fee of €350 (standard value €550-600).
Let me know if this makes sense to you, and if you have any thoughts, requests, or questions.
Looking forward to hearing from you,
Natalia.
